To test this program you just run main.py. 
You can modify it by changing the numbers at line 149. It will change how long the string s is and how many times it will be run.
Right now the length of x and y is capped at sqrt(|s|) due to it's very unlikely to be a interweave given random data for large |x| and |y|. You can change the range to be higher or lower by changing line 37-38. You can make it dependent on |s| or some constant number.
You can also run the main function by un-comment lines 145-148 and update the inputs to anything you want.
The output will be saved in a file called output.txt and the console will show whether the answer is true or false.
If you want to run the program again and save previous output. Make sure you move the output.txt file or rename it since it will be overwritten every time the progam runs.

Sample inputs are in line 145-148 as their outputs in output.txt
